# Go Software Architecture

Go Software Architecture is a project focused on building backend services using the Go programming language and modern architectural principles including Hexagonal Architecture, Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to achieve high maintainability, modularity, testability, and scalability

Example Project :
